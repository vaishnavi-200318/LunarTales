One evening, Kaito noticed a single firefly that shone brighter than all the others, and he felt an inexplicable connection to its light. Night after night, the firefly guided Kaito through the forest, leading him to places of extraordinary beauty and peace. As time passed, Kaito began to realize that he had fallen in love with the mysterious firefly, whose light seemed to speak to his very soul.</h3> </div>

Moved by Kaito’s gentle nature and the bond they had formed, Yume began to fall in love with him as well, but she knew that her time in the human world was limited. One night, as they sat by the lake under a starry sky, Yume revealed her true form to Kaito—a beautiful, ethereal being with a heart as pure as her light. Kaito, though surprised, accepted her love without hesitation, knowing that their connection transcended the boundaries of their worlds.</h3></div>

With tears in his eyes, Kaito watched as Yume transformed back into a firefly and disappeared into the morning mist. Though heartbroken, Kaito knew that Yume’s love would remain with him forever, and every night, he returned to the lake, where a single, bright firefly danced above the water, reminding him of the love they had shared.</h3></div>
